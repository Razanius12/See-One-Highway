# See One Highway

"See One Highway" is a fast-paced top-down 2D car racing game set in Japan, offering players an intense street-racing experience with simple gameplay and intuitive controls.

## Description  
This is a prototype game developed in **Construct 2**, currently in the alpha stage. The game lacks "quality of life" features, and most assets are placeholders. Debug mode may be accidentally triggered. Expect bugs during gameplay.

## Installation & Development Guide

### **Prerequisites**
1. **Construct 2** (to edit `.caproj` files).  
2. **NW.js** (Node-WebKit) for exporting and testing standalone builds.  
   - Download: [NW.js Builds](https://nwjs.io/) (use the "Normal" build to disable devtools).  

### **Exporting the Project**
1. **Export as `.caproj`**:  
   - Save your Construct 2 project as a `.caproj` file (project folder).  
2. **Export as NW.js Desktop**:  
   - In Construct 2, use **File > Export > NW.js (Windows/Mac/Linux)**.  
   - This generates a folder with `nw.exe` and `package.nw`.  

### **Optimizing Startup Time**  
The `package.nw` file bundles all assets and can slow startup. Hereâ€™s how to fix it:  

1. **Repackage `package.nw`**:  
   ```bash
   # Rename and extract the bundle
   cd path/to/exported/Win32-or-Win64-folder
   mv package.nw package.zip
   unzip package.zip -d package.nw
   rm package.zip  # Delete the original file
   ```  
   This reduces load times by avoiding ZIP compression overhead.  

### **Disable Chrome DevTools**  
Prevent users from accessing developer tools:  

1. Edit `package.json` in your exported folder:  
   ```json
   {
     "main": "index.html",
     "name": "SeeOneHighway",
     "chromium-args": "--disable-devtools --js-flags=--expose-gc"
   }  
   ```  
   - Add `--disable-devtools` to block `F12`/right-click access.  
   - Use the **"Normal" NW.js build** for full devtools removal.  

### **Fix Memory Bloat (Garbage Collection)**  
Force garbage collection to unload unused audio/textures:  

1. Add the following to `package.json`:  
   ```json
   "chromium-args": "--js-flags=--expose-gc"  
   ```  
2. Add this JavaScript code to your Construct 2 project (e.g., in a "Start of Layout" event):  
   ```javascript
   // Manually trigger garbage collection
   global.gc();  
   ```  

### **Font Handling**  
- All fonts are embedded as **sprite fonts** in Construct 2.  
- To edit fonts:  
  1. Rebuild the sprite font in Construct 2.  
  2. Avoid changing font names to prevent broken references.

### **Troubleshooting**  
- **Slow Startup**: Repackage `package.nw` as shown above.  
- **DevTools Still Accessible**: Use the **"Normal" NW.js build** instead of SDK.  
- **Memory Leaks**: Call `global.gc()` periodically in your code.
